This repository is only used for hosting content for [reformationfundraising.com](https://reformationfundraising.com). Nothing technical at all going on here, but I have to keep the repository public so that the GitHub Pages site can remain live for [reformationfundraising.com](https://reformationfundraising.com) to pull from.
